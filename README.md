### Administrator:

### Instructor:
As a instructor, what the user cares the most is how his students are doing with their academics currently, what he can help them if they meet any problems, and how he can improve on the curriculum that the school is delivering to the students. 

By clicking on the Instructor Dahboard button in the sidebar, there are 5 charts shown on the screen.
1. Top 20 Level being completed by most students: By looking at the top 20 levels being completed by most students, the instructor is able to evaluate on the learning progess of this cohort of students and examine on the difficulty level of the course as well. 
2. Top 10 most and least active students in the course. These 2 charts help the instructor to know who are the most and least active students in the course, based on the number of actions they took last week. For the least active students, instructors might be insterested to find out why they are not actively participating in the course and help them accordingly. However, being the most active students does not mean they are the ones who finished the most number of levels. 
3. Ten students with the highest average number of attempts: This chart shows that this group of students attempted the most number of times per level. It would be very useful for the instructor to examine on the reasons why they attempted so many times and help them accordingly.
4. Learning curve of a particular student: The instructor is allowed to zoom into one particular student's learning curve, which is the number of actions per week and plotted in a line chart.
